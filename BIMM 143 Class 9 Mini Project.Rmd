# 1. Prepare the data
```{r}
fna.data <- "https://bioboot.github.io/bimm143_F21/class-material/WisconsinCancer.csv"
wisc.df <- read.csv(fna.data, row.names=1)
wisc.df
```
```{r}
# We can use -1 here to remove the first column
wisc.data <- wisc.df[,-1]
```

```{r}
# Create diagnosis vector for later 
diagnosis <- as.numeric(wisc.df$diagnosis =="M")
```

## Exploratory Data Analysis

Q1. How many observations are in this dataset? **569 observations**
```{r}
nrow(wisc.data)
```

Q2. How many of the observations have a malignant diagnosis? **212 observations**
```{r}
sum(diagnosis)
```

Q3. How many variables/features in the data are suffixed with _mean? **10 variables**
```{r}
length(grep("_mean", colnames(wisc.data)))
```

# 2. Principal Component Analysis

## Performing PCA

```{r}
# Check column means and standard deviations
colMeans(wisc.data)

apply(wisc.data,2,sd)
```

Execute PCA with the prcomp() function on the wisc.data, scaling if appropriate, and assign the output model to wisc.pr.

```{r}
# Perform PCA on wisc.data by completing the following code
wisc.pr <- prcomp(wisc.data, scale = TRUE)
```
```{r}
# Look at summary of results
summary(wisc.pr)
```
Q4. From your results, what proportion of the original variance is captured by the first principal components (PC1)? **0.4427, or 44.27%**

Q5. How many principal components (PCs) are required to describe at least 70% of the original variance in the data? **3 PCs are required (PC1-3)**

Q6. How many principal components (PCs) are required to describe at least 90% of the original variance in the data? **7 PCs are required (PC1-7)**

## Interpreting PCA Results

```{r}
#Create a biplot of the wisc.pr using the biplot() function.
biplot(wisc.pr)
```

Q7. What stands out to you about this plot? Is it easy or difficult to understand? Why? **This plot has too many data points clustered on top each other, making the plot difficult to understand.**

So lets generate a more standard scatter plot of each observation along principal components 1 and 2 (i.e. a plot of PC1 vs PC2 available as the first two columns of wisc.pr$x) and color the points by the diagnosis (available in the diagnosis vector you created earlier).

```{r}
# Scatter plot observations by components 1 and 2
plot(wisc.pr$x[, c(1, 2)], col = (diagnosis + 1), 
     xlab = "PC1", ylab = "PC2")
```

Q8. Generate a similar plot for principal components 1 and 3. What do you notice about these plots? **Both plots show pretty similar patterns and clusters of red and black dots**

```{r}
# Repeat for components 1 and 3
plot(wisc.pr$x[, c(1, 3)], col = (diagnosis + 1), 
     xlab = "PC1", ylab = "PC3")
```

Using ggplot2 package
```{r}
# Create a data.frame for ggplot
df <- as.data.frame(wisc.pr$x)
df$diagnosis <- diagnosis

# Load the ggplot2 package
library(ggplot2)

# Make a scatter plot colored by diagnosis
ggplot(df) + 
  aes(PC1, PC2, col=diagnosis) +
  geom_point()
```

## Variance explained

Calculate the variance of each principal component by squaring the sdev component of wisc.pr (i.e. wisc.pr$sdev^2). Save the result as an object called pr.var
```{r}
# Calculate variance of each component
pr.var <- wisc.pr$sdev^2
head(pr.var)
```

Calculate the variance explained by each principal component by dividing by the total variance explained of all principal components. Assign this to a variable called pve and create a plot of variance explained for each principal component.
```{r}
# Variance explained by each principal component: pve
pve <- pr.var / sum(pr.var)

# Plot variance explained for each principal component
plot(pve, xlab = "Principal Component", 
     ylab = "Proportion of Variance Explained", 
     ylim = c(0, 1), type = "o")
```

```{r}
# Alternative scree plot of the same data, note data driven y-axis
barplot(pve, ylab = "Precent of Variance Explained",
     names.arg=paste0("PC",1:length(pve)), las=2, axes = FALSE)
axis(2, at=pve, labels=round(pve,2)*100 )
```

OPTIONAL: There are quite a few CRAN packages that are helpful for PCA. This includes the factoextra package. Feel free to explore this package. For example:
```{r}
## ggplot based graph
#install.packages("factoextra")
library(factoextra)
fviz_eig(wisc.pr, addlabels = TRUE)
```

## Communicating PCA Results

Q9. For the first principal component, what is the component of the loading vector (i.e. wisc.pr$rotation[,1]) for the feature concave.points_mean? **-0.26085376**
```{r}
wisc.pr$rotation[,1]
```
Q10. What is the minimum number of principal components required to explain 80% of the variance of the data? **at least 5 PCs because the graph shows PC5 as the first point above 80% variance**
```{r}
plot(cumsum(pve), xlab = "Principal Component", 
     ylab = "Cumulative Proportion of Variance Explained", 
     ylim = c(0, 1), type = "b")
```

# 3. Hierarchical clustering

First scale the wisc.data data and assign the result to data.scaled.
```{r}
# Scale the wisc.data data using the "scale()" function
data.scaled <- scale(wisc.data)
```

Calculate the (Euclidean) distances between all pairs of observations in the new scaled dataset and assign the result to data.dist.
```{r}
data.dist <- dist(data.scaled)
```

Create a hierarchical clustering model using complete linkage. Manually specify the method argument to hclust() and assign the results to wisc.hclust.
```{r}
wisc.hclust <- hclust(data.dist, method = "complete")
```

## Results of hierarchical clustering

Letâ€™s use the hierarchical clustering model you just created to determine a height (or distance between clusters) where a certain number of clusters exists.

Q11. Using the plot() and abline() functions, what is the height at which the clustering model has 4 clusters? **at around h = 19**
```{r}
plot(wisc.hclust)
abline(h=19, col="red", lty=2)
```

## Selecting number of clusters

Use cutree() to cut the tree so that it has 4 clusters. Assign the output to the variable wisc.hclust.clusters.
```{r}
wisc.hclust.clusters <- cutree(wisc.hclust, k = 4)
```

We can use the table() function to compare the cluster membership to the actual diagnoses.
```{r}
table(wisc.hclust.clusters, diagnosis)
```
Here we picked four clusters and see that cluster 1 largely corresponds to malignant cells (with diagnosis values of 1) whilst cluster 3 largely corresponds to benign cells (with diagnosis values of 0).

Q12. Can you find a better cluster vs diagnoses match by cutting into a different number of clusters between 2 and 10? **No, cutting the tree at 4 clusters already covered the majority of diagnoses match.**

## Using Different Methods

Q13. Which method gives your favorite results for the same data.dist dataset? Explain your reasoning. **As seen from all of the graphs below, my favorite is the "complete" method because the dendrogram is clear to understand and it is the easiest one to determine the height at which the clustering model has 4 clusters.**
```{r}
# Check out "single" method
wisc.hclust.single <- hclust(data.dist, method = "single")
plot(wisc.hclust.single)
```

```{r}
# Check out "complete" method
wisc.hclust.complete <- hclust(data.dist, method = "complete")
plot(wisc.hclust.complete)
abline(h=19, col="red", lty=2)
```

```{r}
# Check out "average" method
wisc.hclust.average <- hclust(data.dist, method = "average")
plot(wisc.hclust.average)
abline(h=12.5, col="red", lty=2)
```

```{r}
# Check out "ward.D2" method
wisc.hclust.D2 <- hclust(data.dist, method = "ward.D2")
plot(wisc.hclust.D2)
abline(h=32.5, col="red", lty=2)
```

# 5. Combining methods

## Clustering on PCA results

```{r}
wisc.pr.hclust <- hclust(data.dist, method = "ward.D2")
grps <- cutree(wisc.pr.hclust, k=2)
table(grps)
```
```{r}
table(grps, diagnosis)
```
```{r}
plot(wisc.pr$x[,1:2], col=grps)
```
```{r}
plot(wisc.pr$x[,1:2], col=diagnosis)
```

```{r}
g <- as.factor(grps)
levels(g)
```

```{r}
g <- relevel(g,2)
levels(g)
```

```{r}
# Plot using our re-ordered factor 
plot(wisc.pr$x[,1:2], col=g)
```

```{r}
## Use the distance along the first 7 PCs for clustering i.e. wisc.pr$x[, 1:7]
dist <- dist(wisc.pr$x[,1:7])
wisc.pr.hclust <- hclust(dist, method="ward.D2")
```

Cut this hierarchical clustering model into 2 clusters and assign the 
results to wisc.pr.hclust.clusters.
```{r}
wisc.pr.hclust.clusters <- cutree(wisc.pr.hclust, k=2)
```

Q15. How well does the newly created model with four clusters separate out the two diagnoses? **very well**
```{r}
# Compare to actual diagnoses
table(wisc.pr.hclust.clusters, diagnosis)
```

Q16. How well do the k-means and hierarchical clustering models you created in previous sections (i.e. before PCA) do in terms of separating the diagnoses? Again, use the table() function to compare the output of each model (wisc.km$cluster and wisc.hclust.clusters) with the vector containing the actual diagnoses.
```{r}
wisc.km <- kmeans(scale(wisc.data), centers=2, nstart=20)
table(wisc.km$cluster, diagnosis)
table(wisc.hclust.clusters, diagnosis)
```
# 6. Sensitivity/Specificity

Q17. Which of your analysis procedures resulted in a clustering model with the best specificity? How about sensitivity? **Specificity = Hierarchical. Sensitivity = Kmeans**

#7. Prediction

We will use the predict() function that will take our PCA model from before and new cancer cell data and project that data onto our PCA space.
```{r}
#url <- "new_samples.csv"
url <- "https://tinyurl.com/new-samples-CSV"
new <- read.csv(url)
npc <- predict(wisc.pr, newdata=new)
npc
```
```{r}
plot(wisc.pr$x[,1:2], col=g)
points(npc[,1], npc[,2], col="blue", pch=16, cex=3)
text(npc[,1], npc[,2], c(1,2), col="white")
```

Q18. Which of these new patients should we prioritize for follow up based on your results? **We should prioritize Patient 1 because Patient 1's cancer is malignant (black). Patient 2's cancer is benign (red)**
